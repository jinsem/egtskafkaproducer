# EGTS Apache Kafka producer

Server application to consume and parse data from EGTS devices, convert it into Avro objects and produce to an APache Kafka topic. 

Most of the ideas for this application have been borrowed from here https://github.com/kuznetsovin/egts

This library https://github.com/kuznetsovin/egts/tree/master/pkg/egtslib is used to parse messages from EGTS devices
